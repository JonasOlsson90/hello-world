# hello-world
Test

I am totally new to this programming thing, know nothing about computers and have only been working whith landscaping all my life.
I am trying to learn C# and .NET and a little bit of python. It seems fun and programmers are super awesome so I would like to become one myself.
To old to code but to young to die landscaping? Yeah, probably, but what the hell, let's give it a go.


Tjohej!
